Tic Tac Toe Project

A SPA project where a user can play against themselves in the game of Tic Tac Toe. Here, I've implemented the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as using jQuery, Bootstrap, and working with API to build the application.

For the initial planning stage, I worked with simple user stories and wireframes. I tackled the API portion first. After completing the first part of API-related components and realizing the game engine/UI portion would be more challenging/time-consuming, I divided my time working on the two components simultaneously. This, I found, helped me prioritize my time better. It let me adhere more efficiently to the scheduled timeline for project completion

It was quite challenging trying to figure out a lot of the game logic. There was much help to be found in the issue cue the entire class participated in, even in others' issues. I recieved a lot of help debugging from others, but I'm starting to see ways I can personally debug on my own, or rather, recognizing what and where I can find errors.

Unsolved/missing components (for future iterations):
  - User message when there is a draw
  - Retrieving game stats for each user. (curl script currently working but not UI or ajax call to API)
  - Change-password/sign-out not available prior to sign-up/sign-in
  - Sign-up/sign-in not available upon sign-up/sign-in
  - Clearing forms after submission
